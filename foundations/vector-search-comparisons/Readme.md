### Hosting

Do you have own engineering team to look after self-hosting a vector database? If you do, you might consider hosting it with the help of your team, but it is also an opportunity cost by itself. If you donâ€™t, having the vector database managed might be a good solution.

### Performance

What latency requirements does your app have? Is it served online or in batch offline mode?
