# File Search

There are two approaches with file search, which should be evaluated according to use case:

- [File Vector Search](#File Vector Search):Running the files through a vector embedding model before inserting into your storage engine, then supplying a file-as-vector as the query to run similarity calculations.

- [File Contents Search](#File Contents Search): Extracting the contents of your files before storing in your database then supplying terms and/or phrases as queries to your storage engine.
