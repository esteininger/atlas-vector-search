## Vector Search

Vector Search provides the capability for developers to **store** dense vectors, structured around certain algorithms (i.e. KNN), and an engine to **compute** similar vectors (i.e. euclidean distance) for relevance score calculation.

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the vector search landscape inclusive of tutorials, guides, best-practices, and extended learning. Please review the [Education](https://github.com/esteininger/vector-search#education) section to learn more.

Here is how you may use a Vector Search engine within your application search engine architecture:
