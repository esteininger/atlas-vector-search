## Vector Search

Vector Search engines provide the capability for developers to `store` vectors structured around certain algorithms (i.e. KNN), and an engine to `compute` similar vectors (like cosine distance) to determine which vectors are related. 

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the vector search landscape inclusive of tutorials, guides, best-practices, and extended learning. Please review the [Education](https://github.com/esteininger/vector-search#education) section to learn more.

Here is how you may use a Vector Search engine within your application search architecture:

## Education

Although a challenging topic to grasp, there's a myriad of educational resources at your disposal.

### Information Retrieval

Overarching field of education.

- [A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf)
- [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
- [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/)

### Transformer Architecture

Latest breakthrough in the area of converting human content (text, images, etc.) into vector representations.
Transformers are a deep learning model that utilize "self-attention", and differentially weigh the significance of each part of the input data.

-   [BERT Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)

### Similarity Search

In order to determine what is deemed relevant, computers need to measure the distance between points, in this case vectors.
